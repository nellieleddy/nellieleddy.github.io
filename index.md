  ## What Are We Doing Here?
  While this blog is **required** for one of my classes, I do hope to accomplish a few things in addition to just completing an  assignment. Namely:
  
  1. Flex my creative muscles.
  2. Get in touch with the github community.
  3. Document my learning journey in R and data science.

It will be mostly rather uninteresting content *but* if you stick around it might get cooler eventually. [^2]
