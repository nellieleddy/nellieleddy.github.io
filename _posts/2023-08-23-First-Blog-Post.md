After reading the above articles, I've gathered that being a data scientist is essentially being able to manipulate data
for use in a specific way. This involves cleaning and organizing large structured or unstructured data sets in order to
be used for a desired outcome, such as for business efficiency or optimization. It also involves being able to apply 
statistical analysis to said data in order to draw conclusions, recognize patterns, or create visualizations. 

To me, it seems that the main knowledge areas that are important for a data scientist are computer language fluency 
(such as SAS, R, and Python), statistical analysis, problem-solving in order to break down complicated/dirty data,
and effective communication in order to relay conclusions drawn. 

There seems to be a lot of overlap between being a statisticain and a data scientist. The main similarities are being
comfortable interpreting and analyzing data, creating graphical vizualizations, and drawing conclusions based on the 
data. This involves a similar skill set of using computer languages for analysis and being able to communicate results
to interested parties. I think the main difference comes from statisticians generally collecting their own data through
experiments and data scientists generally working with existing data structures.

Personally, I think I align more as a data scientist at the moment. My first class for my masters program here at State
was ST555 SAS programming and I really enjoyed it. The bulk of the class consisted on learning how to read in and clean
data. While I do have a strong math and statistics background as an Applied Mathematics major during my undergraduate
career, I think I might be leaning more towards the data science side of things (mainly because I find the applied 
statistical methods classes to be rather dry - and that seems to be the biggest difference between the two).
